## Control flow


This is the main app directory. With this directory, you will find the main  `go`,
`hmtl`, `css`, and `React` files.

This directory should not be altered with the `master branch`, and all `PRs` should
be tested, reviewed, and approved before `merging` into `master`.

If `issues` are found, please use the (`ISSUES.md`)[#../.github/ISSUES-TEMPLATE.md] template
file to properly format what you have found.
